# API Punk Project :beer:
## Description
This project was designed to test my knowledge in API's and also to teach me how to extract data from a 3rd party data source and display the information in an elegant way. Filter and Search functionality was implementated through the use of UseStates and UseEffects in React, allowing for datasets to be updated with user input. 

The data API used for this project was Punk API: https://punkapi.com/

## Responsiveness
As always the web page was implemented with mobile-first responsiveness which alters the number of cards being displayed depending on screen size.

### Improvements
- Tests need to be added testing each component of the web page
- Styling of the filter list in the NavBar can be improved
